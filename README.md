# MDAssistant

I'm  making a cli that I can use to perform some handy jobs on my markdown files.
Still new to vim, and I've gots lots to learn, but I really enjoy it. Unfortunately,
since I've caught the bug I don't want to go back to mouse-based editors, so I'm
using Vim for everything, including note-taking. Thought it would be fun to write a
cli (also, sort of a pandoc wrapper) that will make certain file maintenance and
organization tasks easier and more accessible.
